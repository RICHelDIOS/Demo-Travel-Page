# Demo-Travel-Page
A demonstration of my web development skills in the form of a travel company's website. 

This is not an original programmed website, but one that I followed along to make with the instruction of "Academind"
UDEMY "100 Day Coding Challenge" bootcamp. 

THOUGH, I did add my own personal touches such as a favicon & hyperlinks for the content at the 2nd section on the website's 1st page. 

AS WELL AS a link to a YouTube video on travel that links from the "About" section of the header in on the 1st page. While the "About" section of the 2nd webpage's header links to a Wikipedia article on travel.
